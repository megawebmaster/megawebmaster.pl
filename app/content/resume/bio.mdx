## Staff Software Engineer

I'm a software engineer who built a product from the start, heavily contributed to another three
well-established ones and created a lot of of e-commerce plugins. When building solutions I'm focused on user
experience. Always curious, always eager to learn more, always looking for improvements with constant drive
for growth.

I'm truly passionate about delivering great products and making the world a better place, one step at a time.
I want to grow in a product-focused way, so that I can help people around the world live a more fulfilling life.
