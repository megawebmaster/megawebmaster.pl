    title="Staff Software Engineer"

    I focused on figuring out, building, and delivering value that resonates with customers. The job involved adding new
    and improving existing product features, as well as improving developer experience when integrating the product to
    customers’ systems.

    * Improved product’s Integration Guide, which dropped number of questions for each new customer from 5 to 0,
    significantly reducing support needs.
    * Researched, created a proof-of-concept, and delivered an initial, production-ready behavioral analysis feature for
    catching scripted, bot-like user behavior.
    * Created a production-ready browser analysis feature that helps identify bots among millions of requests.
    * Created notifications processing for heavy load API with exactly-once sending behavior, with minimal performance
    impact and cooldown support.
    * Created docs explaining each of 33 signals (product’s feature), wrote 5 new tutorials, 20 changelogs, and improved
    4
    feature pages - all focused on how customers can get value from the product.
    * Added 5 small, quality-of-life improvements to the product.

    This meaningful impact on the product was a result of dedication, positive attitude with thoughtful
    approach, and my passion for problem solving.

    title="Senior Software Engineer"

    I helped clients turn their business ideas into products using technology. We worked together on a daily basis to
    refine their ideas and bring them to life.

    * Simplified event inquiry process from 8 steps to just 3 which led to rising customer happiness from 2/10 to 8/10.
    * Integrated Square for payment processing and Insighly CRM and Mailchimp to manage leads which helped the client
    land more sales.
    * Delivered new, highly interactive React-based admin pages to help the client manage their product better and
    easier. These pages simplified preparing customer-facing reports from an hour to just 10 minutes a day.

    Listening to the clients needs and understanding how to solve them using technology was important in this role.

    title="Product Manager"
  >
    I built a product from ground up: starting with the idea, through user research, UI and UX design, programming and
    infrastructure to delivery.

    * Grew the user base from 3,000 when started to over 70,000 at the beginning of 2023.
    * Created a coherent brand: from choosing fonts and colors, through selecting a brand voice, designing the app and
    landing page to user behavior and experience design.
    * Ran 6 user researches and 3 experiments based on them.
    * Held 2 internal workshops to include the team in development of the product and get a better, more comprehensive
    picture of users behavior and needs.
    * Released a new, brand-aware design.
    * Created and released 12 big features (requiring at least a month of work) and a lot of smaller ones.
    * Set up and secured a Google Cloud Kubernetes cluster that our CI/CD pipeline deployed to automatically with Git,
    Helm and Flux.
    * Kept a Scrum backlog in check, so the rest of my team was always on top of what is going on and what our next
    steps are.

    To achieve these great results I worked hard to assemble a strong, talented and diverse team fully engaged in
    building the product.

    title="Tech Lead"
  >
    I ran a large, eight person Scrum team that delivered 3 new features in a big and
    established Ruby on Rails project.

    * Developed and verified (with a secondary technical solution) a feature for collecting a new metric from Facebook,
    Twitter and Instagram. The feature spanned through three layers of the data processing pipeline up to the
    user-facing reports.
    * Developed and verified a detailed reports support for the same social media platforms (the account and post-level
    data views).
    * Optimized a user-facing, frequently used query from over 3 minutes down to just 15 seconds on a table with
    hundreds of millions of entries.
    * Developed support for a new way of capturing data for special social media accounts.

    Gaining client’s trust and ensuring data consistency and reliability were crucial in this role.
