    # Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
    ## I'm Amadeusz.
  </HeroHeader>
  <HeroBody>
    I'm tinkering with the web since 2004 - the moment I got my first internet connection. Fun fact: it was already
    broadband, I've never used dial-up connections ;)

    I've built multiple e-commerce plugins for [OptArt](https://optart.biz), worked as an engineer on many products at
    [u2i](https://u2i.com) and [Castle](https://castle.io), and created [RetroTool](https://retrotool.io) - a tool that
    helps you make solid retrospectives in distributed teams.

    Now I'm focused on building **beautiful and enjoyable apps** that deliver value to people.
    I'm passionate about creating great products and making the world a better place, one step at a time.
    I want to grow in a product-focused way, so that I can help people around the world live a more fulfilling life.
