  # Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
  ## I'm Amadeusz.

<Body>
  I'm tinkering with the web since 2004 - the moment I got my first internet connection.
  Nowadays, I'm more focused on building products that deliver value to people around the world.

  I'm truly passionate about creating great products and making the world a better place,
  one step at a time. I want to grow in a product-focused way, so that I can help people around
  the world live a more fulfilling life.

  Always curious, always eager to learn more, always looking for improvements with constant drive for growth.
